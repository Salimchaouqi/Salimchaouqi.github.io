        <p> Physical fitness has always been a priority for me from a young age— a healthy body means a healthy mind and a healthy soul. My parents, especially my dad, made sure that I understood that physical exercise translates into every aspect of your life. My father is a tennis coach, and so at the age of three he began teaching me tennis. At one point in my life I was training to become a pro. However, the life of a professional athlete is full of risks and gambles and personally I did not want to gamble my life away so I made the decision to stop. One bad injury and your career is done, which means your future and livelihood are gone. I’m not about that YOLO life (it should be more like YOYO you only yolo once). Playing tennis with my father is still one of my favorite activities to do, and for that reason I make sure to keep my tennis skills from getting rusty so my old man doesn't havent to take it easy on me. I also enjoy playing with my friends. Currently, I genereally play three to four times a week with some friends, many of whom I am currently teaching.

        <h1> Martial Arts</h1>
        <img src="./martialarts.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded about-pics" alt="">
        <h3>
        <p> When I was eight I began to learn martial arts and received my first black belt in mixed martial arts when I was 14. Martial arts is a centralized part of my life. What I like most about martial arts are the values and codes it encompasses, such as the respect, the resolve, and the determination that is instilled in you from the start. To go from a white belt to a black belt requires a lot of perseverance and dedication. I was blessed to find a martial arts school that required you to give it your all and to push past the limits you had previously set for yourself or thought existed. It helped teach me the core values that are instilled in me to this day. In the school you were not only expected to learn but also to teach. Mentoring other students taught me not only compassion but also the patience required to help a fellow student reach new levels. Levels which they did not think were obtainable before. It taught me that sometimes in order to help guide someone to their full potential you are often required to become someone they dislike. After my first black belt I wanted to learn different styles of martial arts. I began learning Kung Fu under an instructor who was a student under one of the three Kung Fu Grand Masters. He limited his class to only four students. My experience in Kung Fu left me in awe and amazement of the Shaolin monks who practice Kung Fu every day. To this day, nothing has compared to the difficulties I faced in my brief time learning this art. The Sensei not only expected you to perform at the best of your capabilities but required you to perform beyond them. I continued my journey here in Gainesville with Shotokan karate where I am currently a brown belt working towards my black belt, which I will hopefully attain a year from now. Although stylistically different from the other martial arts I have learned, it still incorporates the same core values and beliefs.

        <h3>
        <p> I have been an avid gamer from a tender age of five when I first played Donkey Kong. From that I went on to play all the Playstation 1 classics, which include Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy 7 and 8, Fifa 97, etc… Even to this day I am still a Playstation fan, still keeping up with all the classics that I have enjoyed over the years. My primary form of gaming, however, is PC gaming. I have enjoyed much success and entertainment in Blizzard games over the years. I started with World of Warcraft Burning Crusade in 2006. During my time in WOW I had the opportunity to raid with some of the best guilds in the United States, peaking at a US rank eight, while I myself have been a top contender for best US player in PVE for my respective class (player versus environment) and held a rank 12 US team for PVP (player versus player). Due to school, I had to end my WOW career in 2012. Since then I have enjoyed playing Diablo 3 (easily best $40 I have ever spent) in a more casual sense, but my competitive side does comes out from time to time. If you are not doing something to the best of your abilities then you will not be improving, and if you are not improving then why are you wasting your time doing it at all.
